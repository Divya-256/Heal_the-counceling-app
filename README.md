# HEAL-THE COUNCELING APP

## INSPIRATION

Human psychology has always been an area of utmost wonder. A healthy mind is the core of a healthy body. Complicated thoughts and endless emotions, most of the time drags us into anxiety, depression and many other chaos. Moreover, COVID-19 has hit us hard causing the graph of stress and depression to rise rapidly. Studies have shown that symptoms of anxiety and depression have increased from 11% to 39% during the pandemic time. Consulting a psychologist or seeking help from a therapist can be of great help but again the pandemic has closed those doors shut. Many of the times, analyzing the mental and emotional state of the person accurately is a challenge for therapists. We have put our minds together to tackle all these problems and here we are with the HEAL App. 

## The Idea

The main objective of our app is to help people connect with the best therapists beyond any physical restrictions. A person can seek help from the therapist of their choice through a video meeting. They can also choose any language according to their preference. In this modern era where AI and ML have already touched the nook and corner of various fields, we tried to incorporate the same in our app. During the video meeting, the mental state of the person which includes stress, anxiety, depression and confidence levels is evaluated and displayed on the therapist's screen which enables him to assess the person precisely. This is made possible by feeding various data sets and developing ML/AI algorithms. Our app also provides a feature for analysing the progress of the person with the help of level bars and day-to-day reports. A 24*7 service support is also made available for seamless assistance.Many training programs are also available including yoga,fitness training,diet plan,meditation,motivational programs etc that can be chosen by the user according to their needs.


## What's Next

Every meeting is recorded and the useful data from it is used to increase the accuracy of further consultations. Over a few months, with the increase of available data set, the app will attain 95-100% accuracy. When we look ahead, we see this app turning into a perfection, constantly providing support for millions around the world.
